TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

My app is finished and works perfectly well when I open a page for it using Live Server, however 
it doesn't work very well on github pages because I assume I didn't commit my firebaseConfig.js code and API key
as I was advised. Please ask me for the code for that file if you are doing a demo for my app when you are judging for winners
for the GDSC Firebase Contest.
